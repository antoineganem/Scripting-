    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create
        dynamically updating content,
        control multimedia, animate images,
        and much more. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language
    </p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <table> 
        <tr>
            <th>Variable</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>var</td>
            <td>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value</td>
            <td>var x = 5;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>let</td>
            <td>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value</td>
            <td>let x = 5;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>const</td>
            <td>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant</td>
            <td>const x = 5;</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Variables define by the let and var keyword can change values with the equal operator = </p>
    <h2>Control flow</h2>
    <div id="ControlFlow-container">
        <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
             A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 
             Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
             Statements are like individual sentences. Just as sentences are separated by periods,
            JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>
        <p>As JavaScript is a interpreted language it runs from top to bottom reading and executing line by 
            line. 
        </p>
        <h3>Conditional execution</h3>
        <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
            In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>if statement - use to execute a block of code if a condition is true</li>
            <li>else statement - use to execute a block of code if the same condition is false</li>
            <li>else if statement - use to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is false</li>
            <li>switch statement - use to select one of many code blocks to be executed</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/images/javascriptImages/conditionalImage.png" alt="conditional image">
        <h3>While Loops</h3>
        <p>It is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
            The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
        </p>
        <p>As an example that actually does something useful,
            we can now write a program that calculates and shows 
            the value of 2 to the 10th power.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/javascriptImages/whileLoops.png" alt="while loop image">
        <h3>For Loops</h3>
        <p>It is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.
            A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to 
            execute a specific number of times.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <div id="function-container">
        <p>A function is a block of code that can be called by name. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.
            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. Functions can return data as a result.
            It helps to avoid repeating code and makes the code more readable and reusable.
        </p>
        <code> 
            function myFunction(p1, p2) { </br>
                return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2 <br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>Functions are defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().</p>
        <h3>Asynchronous Functions</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it has only one call stack and one memory heap.
            Asynchronous functions are functions that return a promise. A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure)
            of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
        </p>
        <p>To handle asynchronous operations, JavaScript uses a special keyword <code>async</code>. An asynchronous function can contain an <code>await</code> expression,
            which pauses the execution of the function and waits for the promise to resolve, then resumes the execution and returns the resolved value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>await</code> keyword can only be used inside an <code>async</code> function. This allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
            While waiting for the promise to resolve, the interpreter can continue executing other code.
        </p>
        <code>
            async function fetchData() { <br>
                const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); <br>
                const data = await response.json(); <br>
                console.log(data); <br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>In the example above, the <code>fetchData</code> function fetches data from an API and waits for the response. It then waits for the response to be converted to JSON
            and logs the data to the console.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities. They are used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
            An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”),
            and value can be anything.
        </p>
        <p>Objects are mutable, meaning their properties can be changed, and new properties can be added.</p>
        <h2>JSON Stringify and JSON parse</h2>
        <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
            It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
            <ul>
                <li>JSON.stringify() - Converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string</li>
                <li>JSON.parse() - Converts a JSON string to a JavaScript object</li>
            </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>DOM Manipulation</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes.
        The DOM is used to interact with the HTML document. You can use JavaScript to change the content, structure, and style of an HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>There are several methods and properties that allow you to manipulate the DOM. Some of the most common methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>document.getElementById() - Returns the element with the specified ID</li>
        <li>document.getElementsByClassName() - Returns a collection of elements with the specified class name</li>
        <li>document.getElementsByTagName() - Returns a collection of elements with the specified tag name</li>
        <li>document.createElement() - Creates a new element</li>
        <li>element.innerHTML - Sets or returns the HTML content of an element</li>
        <li>element.style.property - Sets or returns the style of an element</li>
        <li>element.setAttribute() - Sets the value of an attribute on the specified element</li>
        <li>element.addEventListener() - Attaches an event handler to the specified element</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.
        For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box.
    </p>
    <p>There are many types of events that can occur in a web browser, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mouse events - Occur when the mouse is moved or clicked</li>
        <li>Keyboard events - Occur when a key is pressed or released</li>
        <li>Form events - Occur when a form is submitted or reset</li>
        <li>Document events - Occur when the document is loaded or unloaded</li>
        <li>Window events - Occur when the browser window is resized or scrolled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Event listeners are used to listen for events and execute code when they occur. You can add event listeners to elements using the addEventListener() method.</p> 
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <h2>Mouse Event Example</h2>
    <button id="mouseEventBtn">Click me</button>
    <p id="mouseEventResult"></p>

    <h2>Keyboard Event Example</h2>
    <input type="text" id="keyboardEventInput" placeholder="Type something...">
    <p id="keyboardEventResult"></p>

    <h2>Form Event Example</h2>
    <form id="formEvent">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p id="formEventResult"></p>
